This project is a fork of a previous CCAPDEV application titled "123: Commute mo, Ikwento mo!".

123: Commute mo, Ikwento mo! is a forum web application wherein members can share their memorable commuting stories to the outside world! Individuals can learn a thing or two since they are given the freedom to comment with each other. Upvoting, downvoting, and many more features are here as well so we can attain the minimalistic and satisfying ui.
